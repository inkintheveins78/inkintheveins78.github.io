                <p>Let me tell you a story.</p>
            </div>
            <p>When I was growing up, I always made things. My first love, like many other children, was Lego. I built everything I could imagine, all day. 
                When I was in third grade, I made a play with my classmates, all on our own. 
                In fourth grade, I worked with my friends to make comics.
                In fifth and sixth, I would draw pictures for my friends and family so they could see a different version of themself.
                When I got to seventh grade, I discovered my passion for web design and coding after I saw what a few key strokes and some motivation could do.
                Eventually, I got to making the websites you see below, all of which derive of my desire to constantly create.
                <br><br><b>I am a creator, not just a web designer</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src = "profile.jpg" height = "300px" width = "300px"><br><br>
    
        <div class = "projectimages">
            <div class = "grow"><a href="https://amiu.000webhostapp.com/"><img src = "amistuff.png" width = "150px" class = "left"></a></div>
            <div class = "grow"><a href="https://bsatroop387.000webhostapp.com/387.html?"><img src = "bsa387.png" width = "150px" class = "center"></a></div>
            <div class = "grow"><a href="https://htmlearn-official.000webhostapp.com/"><img src = "htmlearn.png" width = "150px" class = "right"></a></div><br><br>
        </div>

        <div class = "projects">
        <h2 id = "projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>Below are a few projects that I believe show my skill and abilities best. First, amistuff, which is a way for me to store all my medias, like my youtube channel, blog and my games that I coded in scratch and ruby.
            Next is my BSA troop's website. I earned the programming merit badge so I was given the position of webmaster, and I made this website after noticing we didn't have one.
            Lastly is HTMLearn, which is my way to sell a course I made on web design. 
            <br><br>I feel that all of these websites are some of my best work, but they have all been consistently updated after learning new design and code concepts, showing how I can learn and adapt.
